    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Effective Date: August 2, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("you," "your," or "User") and Tapestral Inc. ("Tapestral," "we," "us," or "our") governing your access to and use of the Tapestral platform, website, and related services (collectively, the "Services").
      By accessing, browsing, registering for, or otherwise using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      The Services are intended solely for use by businesses and authorized representatives of businesses. By using our platform, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind your organization to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Orders and Payment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All product orders placed through Tapestral are subject to acceptance by the manufacturer.</li>
      <li>Prices displayed do not include shipping, taxes, or duties unless explicitly stated otherwise.</li>
      <li>Payment must be rendered in full prior to order processing unless otherwise agreed in writing. Payment processing is handled via third-party providers (e.g., Stripe), and we are not liable for any issues arising from such processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Shipping Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Tapestral does not provide or manage shipping. The designer (buyer) is solely responsible for selecting and engaging a third-party carrier. The manufacturer will coordinate with the selected carrier to fulfill delivery. Shipping fees are billed separately and must be paid directly to the carrier or manufacturer. Tapestral assumes no liability for delays, damages, or disputes arising from shipping services.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Returns and Claims</h2>
    <p>
      Returns are subject to the individual return policies of each manufacturer. Many products, including but not limited to custom or made-to-order items, are non-returnable and non-refundable.
      All damage or defect claims must be submitted in writing within five (5) calendar days of delivery. Claims must include detailed photographs and a written description of the issue. Failure to submit a timely claim constitutes a waiver of any such claim.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Product Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      While we strive for accuracy, we do not warrant that product descriptions, measurements, colors, or other content are error-free. It is your responsibility to verify details before purchase. Tapestral shall not be liable for any discrepancies or reliance placed on inaccurate information.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All trademarks, logos, content, software, and materials on the platform are owned or licensed by Tapestral or our partners and are protected by copyright and trademark laws. No right, title, or interest in or to the Services or any content is transferred to you.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TAPESTRAL SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA.
      IN NO EVENT SHALL TAPESTRAL'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO TAPESTRAL IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Tapestral and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, and licensors from and against any and all third-party claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from or related to your use of the Services or your violation of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time and for any reason, including for violations of these Terms or conduct that we deem harmful or inappropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law & Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [Your State], without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in [Your County], [Your State].
    </p>

    <h2>12. Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Your continued use of the Services after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
